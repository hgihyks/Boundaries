Ram Dass\nBe the master of mind rather than mastered by mind. Japanese proverb\nBe the witness of your thoughts. You are what observes, not what you observe.

Anthony de Mello\nThe whole life is a succession of dreams. My ambition is to be a conscious dreamer, that is all. Swami Vivekananda\nThe time to relax is when you don’t have time for it. Sydney J. Harris\nThe only difference between meditation and ordinary social interaction is that the friend you’re gradually coming to know is yourself. Mingyur Rinpoche\nLike water which can clearly mirror the sky and the trees only so long as its surface is undisturbed, the mind can only reflect the true image of the Self when it is tranquil and wholly relaxed. Indra Devi\nMeditation is the only intentional, systematic human activity which at bottom is about not trying to improve yourself or get anywhere else, but simply to realize where you already are. Jon Kabat-Zinn\nInstead of “Let it go,” we should probably say “Let it be”; this recognizes that the mind won’t let go and the problem may not go away, and it allows you to form a healthier relationship with what’s bothering you. Jon Kabat-Zinn\nWhat would it be like if I could accept life – accept this moment – exactly as it is? Tara Brach\nBe at least as interested in what goes on inside you as what happens outside. If you get the inside right, the outside will fall into place. Eckhart Tolle\nMeditation could be said to be the Art of Simplicity: simply sitting, simply breathing and simply being. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche\nThe affairs of the world will go on forever. Do not delay the practice of meditation. Milarepa\nMeditation is not a means to an end. It is both the means and the end. Jiddu Krishnamurti\nMuddy water is best cleared by leaving it alone. Alan Watts\nThe more present I am, the happier and more content I will be. Naval Ravikant\nThere is something wonderfully bold and liberating about saying yes to our entire imperfect and messy life. Tara Brach\nThe only way to live is by accepting each minute as an unrepeatable miracle. Tara Brach\nThe state of your life is nothing more than a reflection of your state of mind. Wayne Dyer\nTo know that you need nothing to be happy, except self-knowledge, is wisdom. Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj\nTwo kinds of happiness. Worldly happiness is reward from our evolutionary program. Get praise, money, drugs, sex. It busies the mind with craving and anxiety. Internal happiness is reward from being in flow. Create, meditate, love, play. It clears the mind and leaves us in peace. Naval Ravikant\nThe problem with meditation, is that it’s not permanent. But what it does give me, is an hour a day, by myself, to work through my thoughts. Naval Ravikant\nHappiness is that state when nothing is missing. When nothing is missing, your mind shuts down and your mind stops running into the future or running into the past to regret something or to plan something. Naval Ravikant\nThe fewer desires I can have, the more I can accept the current state of things, the less my mind is moving because the mind really exists in motion towards the future or the past. Naval Ravikant\nFind single player games that you enjoy, like yoga, meditation, swimming. Naval Ravikant (More on Game Theory in\nDoing a three-minute meditation every day may change your life: It is the gateway drug to slowing down. Anne Lamott\nMaintain your physical, emotional, and\nContemplation is the highest expression of man’s intellectual and spiritual life. It is that life itself, fully awake, fully active, fully aware that it is alive. It is a spiritual wonder. It is spontaneous awe at the sacredness of life, of being. It is gratitude for life, for awareness and for being. Thomas Merton\nI have been a seeker and I still am, but I stopped asking the books and the stars. I started listening to the teaching of my soul.\nThe man who is aware of himself is henceforward independent; and he is never bored, and life is only too short, and he is steeped through and through with a profound yet temperate happiness. Virginia Woolf\nThe moment one gives close attention to anything, even a blade of grass, it becomes a mysterious, awesome, indescribably magnificent world in itself. Henry Miller\nHappiness is your nature. It is not wrong to desire it. What is wrong is seeking it outside when it is inside. Ramana Maharshi\nWithout giving up hope—that there’s somewhere better to be, that there’s someone better to be — we will never relax with where we are or who we are. Pema Chödrön\nThere is only one place to find real peace, real harmony. That place is within. S.N. Goenka\nIf only you will remain resting in consciousness, seeing yourself as distinct from the body, then even now you will become happy, peaceful and free from bonds. Ashtavakra Gita\nMeditation puts into question more or less everything you tend to do in your search for happiness. But if you lose sight of this, it can become just another strategy for seeking happiness — a more refined version of the problem you already have. Sam Harris (Taming The Mind)\nMeditation is painful in the beginning but it bestows immortal bliss and supreme joy in the end. Swami Sivananda\nIt is only when the mind is free from the old that it meets everything anew, and in that there is joy. Jiddu Krishnamurti\nMeditation is one of the greatest arts in life – perhaps the greatest, and one cannot possibly learn it from anybody, that is the beauty of it. Jiddu Krishnamurti\nI don’t mind what happens. That is the essence of inner freedom. It is a timeless spiritual truth: release attachment to outcomes, deep inside yourself, you’ll feel good no matter what. Jiddu Krishnamurti\nRemain calm, serene, always in command of yourself. You will then find out how easy it is to get along. Paramahansa Yogananda\nThis is the mark of perfection of character — to spend each day as if it were your last, without frenzy, laziness, or any pretending. Marcus Aurelius\nDrink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which the world earth revolves – slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future; live the actual moment. Only this moment is life. Thich Nhat Hanh\nOur thinking minds deprive us of the happiness that comes when we are living fully in the moment. Ram Dass\nFrom the perspective of meditation, every state is a special state, every moment a special moment. Jon Kabat-Zinn\nThose who miss meditation miss the whole dance of life. Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh\nAwareness is the greatest agent for change. Eckhart Tolle\nWhenever we attain a higher vision, the lower vision disappears of itself. Swami Vivekananda\nOpen the window of your mind. Allow the fresh air, new lights and new truths to enter. Amit Ray\nSpiritual practice involves, on the one hand, acting out of concern for others’ well-being. On the other, it entails transforming ourselves so that we become more readily disposed to do so. Dalai Lama\nGetting in touch with your true self must be your first priority. Tom Hopkins\nThere are three things extremely hard: steel, a diamond, and to know one’s self. Benjamin Franklin\nEvery human has four endowments – self-awareness, conscience, independent will and creative imagination. These give us the ultimate human freedom… The power to choose, to respond, to change. Stephen R. Covey\nThe gift of learning to meditate is the greatest gift you can give yourself in this lifetime. Sogyal Rinpoche\nKnowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength;\nTo acquire knowledge, one must study; but to acquire wisdom, one must observe. Marilyn vos Savant\nThe more you know yourself, the more clarity there is. Self-knowledge has no end – you don’t come to an achievement, you don’t come to a conclusion. It is an endless river. Jiddu Krishnamurti\nIf you begin to understand what you are without trying to change it, then what you are undergoes a transformation. Jiddu Krishnamurti\nDo you consume libraries worth of articles, video, podcasts? Great. But it is only beneficial to the extent that it is modulated by personal observation, conversations, and deeply reflective, laborious meditation. Without these practices, information is just data. Thibaut\nSelf-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control; these three alone lead life to sovereign power. Alfred Lord Tennyson\nMeditation is the secret of all growth in spiritual life and knowledge. James Allen\nHow pathetically scanty my self-knowledge is compared with, say, my knowledge of my room. There is no such thing as observation of the inner world, as there is of the outer world. Franz Kafka\nWithout self-knowledge, without understanding the working and functions of his machine, man cannot be free, he cannot govern himself and he will always remain a slave. George Gurdjieff\nNo change occurs if we just let our habitual tendencies and automatic patterns of thought perpetuate and even reinforce themselves, thought after thought, day after day, year after year. But those tendencies and patterns can be challenged. Matthieu Ricard\nMeditation is not just blissing out under a mango tree. It completely changes your brain and therefore changes what you are. Matthieu Ricard\nI think self-knowledge is the rarest trait in a human being. Elizabeth Edwards\nThe one self-knowledge worth having is to know one’s own mind. F. H. Bradley\nSelf-knowledge is the first step to maturity. Jane Austen\nYou are only here now; you’re only alive in this moment. Jon Kabat-Zinn\nConsciousness is the one thing in this universe that cannot be an illusion. Sam Harris (Waking Up)\nLearn to see what you are looking at. Christopher Paolini\nAltogether, the idea of meditation is not to create states of ecstasy or absorption, but to experience being. Chögyam Trungpa\nThe things that trouble our spirits are within us already. In meditation, we must face them, accept them, and set them aside one by one. Cristopher L. Bennett\nIf you can resist the impulse to claim each and every thought as your own, you will come to a startling conclusion: you will discover that you are the consciousness in which the thoughts appear and disappear. Annamalai Swami\nThe entire exercise of\nFor me it is a way to understand reality – about myself first of all and then reality about the rest of the world, without any stories and fictions and mythologies. Just to observe what is really happening. Yuval Noah Harari\nThe human mind is a factory of generating fictional stories about yourself, your family, your country, the world. It’s so difficult to tell the difference between the stories we invent and reality. Yuval Noah Harari\nWhenever you try to dictate the outcome of your meditation you negate its most wondrous benefit – the pleasure of simply being. Paul Wilson\nHappiness to me is mainly not suffering, not desiring, not thinking too much about the future or the past, really embracing the present moment and the reality of what is, the way it is. Naval Ravikant\nMeditation is about keeping the mind clear; thinking deeply about reality. It’s about thinking about our emotions, asking ourselves ‘Why do I feel angry?’ and coming to understand the advantages and sound basis of positive emotions like warmheartedness. Dalai Lama\nThink hard, dig deep, do not take appearances for reality. Robert Greene\nMeditation is such a more substantial reality than what we normally take to be reality. Richard Gere\nThe ability to observe without evaluating is the highest form of intelligence. Jiddu Krishnamurti\nThought is so cunning, so clever, that it distorts everything for its own convenience. Jiddu Krishnamurti\nWhy do you want to read others’ books when there is the book of yourself? Jiddu Krishnamurti\nAll the suffering, stress, and addiction comes from not realizing you already are what you are looking for. Jon Kabat-Zinn\nSilence is not an absence but a presence. Anne D. LeClaire\nPrayer is when you talk to God; Meditation is when you listen to God. Diana Robinson\nMeditation is a vital way to purify and quiet the mind, thus rejuvenating the body. Deepak Chopra\nWhen you reach a calm and quiet meditative state, that is when you can hear the sound of silence. Stephen Richards\nSilence isn’t empty, it’s full of answers. Unknown\nWithin each of us there is a silence, a silence as vast as the universe. And when we experience that silence, we remember who we are. Gunilla Norris\nEverything that’s created comes out of silence. Your thoughts emerge from the nothingness of silence. Your words come out of this void. Your very essence emerged from emptiness. All creativity requires some stillness. Wayne Dyer\nTrue silence is the rest of the mind, and is to the spirit what sleep is to the body, nourishment and refreshment. William Penn\nThat deep silence has a melody of its own, a sweetness unknown amid the harsh discords of the world’s sounds. Paul Brunton\nWe live, in fact, in a world starved for solitude, silence, and private: and therefore starved for meditation and true friendship. C.S. Lewis\nThe soul always knows what to do to heal itself. The challenge is to silence the mind. Caroline Myss\nThe stiller you are the calmer life is. Rasheed Ogunlaru\nOne who is patient glows with an inner radiance. Allan Lokos\nThe body benefits from movement, and the mind benefits from stillness. Sakyong Mipham\nSo the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing. T. S. Eliot\nLearning how to be still, to really be still and let life happen – that stillness becomes a radiance. Morgan Freeman\nHave patience with all things, But, first of all with yourself. Saint Francis de Sales\nThe two hardest tests on the spiritual road are the patience to wait for the right moment and the courage not to be disappointed with what we encounter. Paulo Coelho\nComfort is no test of truth. Truth is often far from being comfortable. Swami Vivekananda\nInner stillness is the key to outer strength. Jared Brock\nTrue intelligence operates silently. Stillness is where creativity and solutions to problems are found. Eckhart Tolle\nBe the silent watcher of your thoughts and behavior. You are beneath the thinker. You are the stillness beneath the mental noise. You are the love and joy beneath the pain. Eckhart Tolle\nIn the midst of movement and chaos, keep stillness inside of you. Deepak Chopra\nPatience is the companion of wisdom. Augustine of Hippo\nIt is only with total humility, and in absolute stillness of mind that we can know what indeed we are. Wei Wu Wei\nMeditation is a state you’re in when you’re not doing anything – physically, mentally, or consciously. You’re just making no effort. You’re literally being completely still, physically and mentally, inside and out. Naval Ravikant\nTo understand the immeasurable, the mind must be extraordinarily quiet, still. Jiddu Krishnamurti\nYou might be tempted to avoid the messiness of daily living for the tranquility of stillness and peacefulness. This, of course, would be an attachment to stillness, and like any strong attachment, it leads to delusion. It arrests development and short-circuits the cultivation of wisdom. Jon Kabat-Zinn\nPatience is a form of wisdom. It demonstrates that we understand and accept the fact that sometimes things must unfold in their own time. Jon Kabat-Zinn\nStillness within one individual can affect society beyond measure. Bede Griffiths\nIf water derives lucidity from stillness, how much more the faculties of the mind. Zhuangzi\nThe trees that are slow to grow bear the best fruit. Molière\nLife is a dance. Mindfulness is witnessing that dance. Amit Ray\nRaise you awareness and share your uniqueness to the world. Amit Ray\nMindfulness is a way of befriending ourselves and our experience. Jon Kabat-Zinn\nMindfulness practice means that we commit fully in each moment to be present; inviting ourselves to interface with this moment in full awareness, with the intention to embody as best we can an orientation of calmness, mindfulness, and equanimity right here and right now. Jon Kabat-Zinn\nWhen we pay focused attention to our bodily sensations, we can recognize the ebb and flow of our emotions and, with that, increase our control over them. Bessel van der Kolk\nCreate a gap of no-mind in which you are highly alert and aware but not thinking. This is the essence of meditation. Eckhart Tolle\nAwareness requires living in the here and now, and not in the elsewhere, the past or the future. Eric Berne\nIn your present-moment awareness, awaken to your innocence, your trust, your love, your eternal being. Deepak Chopra\nMindfulness is the miracle by which we master and restore ourselves. Thich Nhat Hanh\nRather than being your thoughts and emotions, be the awareness behind them. Eckhart Tolle\nWe can’t control what thoughts and emotions arise within us, nor can we control the universal truth that everything changes. But we can learn to step back and rest in the awareness of what’s happening. That awareness can be our refuge. Sharon Salzberg\nRestore your attention or bring it to a new level by dramatically slowing down whatever you’re doing. Sharon Salzberg\nThe first step toward change is awareness. The second step is acceptance. Nathaniel Branden\nLet us not look back in anger, nor forward in fear, but around in awareness. James Thurber\nMindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience. It isn’t more complicated than that. It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. Sylvia Boorstein\nIn awareness there is no becoming, there is no end to be gained. There is silent observation without choice and condemnation, from which there comes understanding. Jiddu Krishnamurti\nThe next message you need is always right where you are. Ram Dass\nThe more we witness our emotional reactions and understand how they work, the easier it is to refrain. Pema Chödrön\nYou must be completely awake in the present to enjoy the tea. Thich Nhat Hanh\nAwareness without action is worthless. Phil McGraw\nThat’s life: starting over, one breath at a time. Sharon Salzberg\nBreath is the finest gift of nature. Be grateful for this wonderful gift. Amit Ray\nIf you want to conquer the anxiety of life, live in the moment, live in the breath. Amit Ray\nIf you have time to breathe you have time to meditate. You breathe when you walk. You breathe when you stand. You breathe when you lie down. Ajahn Amaro\nThis is universal. You sit and observe your breath. You can’t say this is a Hindu breath or a Christian breath or a Muslim breath. Charles Johnson\nMere physical sitting is not enough. You have to sit carefully and attentively. Let your body and breathing sit. Let your mind and emotions sit. Let your blood circulation sit. Let everything sit. Then your sitting becomes indestructible, immovable. Maezumi Roshi\nBe aware of your breathing. Notice how this takes attention away from your thinking and creates space. Eckhart Tolle\nBreathing is central to every aspect of meditation training. It’s a wonderful place to focus in training the mind to be calm and concentrated.

नकारात्मक तनाव को सकारात्मक में बदला जा सकता है।\nपूरी जिंदगी जीने और सकारात्मक पर ध्यान केंद्रित करें।\nएक बार सकारात्मक विचारों के साथ नकारात्मक सोच को बदलने के बाद आप सकारात्मक परिणाम प्राप्त करना शुरू करेंगे।\nअंतिम प्रेरणा समय सीमा है।\nअगर आप पढ़ना पसंद नहीं करते है तो इस का मतलब आपको सही किताब नहीं मिली है।\nएक सपना हजार वास्तविकताओं से अधिक शक्तिशाली है।\nयदि आप छोड़ना सीखते है तो यह आपकी आदत बन जाती है।\nसोच भय से दूर नहीं होगी लेकिन कारवाई होगी।\nयदि आपके पास शरीर है तो आप एक खिलाडी है और आप जीत सकते है।\nसफलता अक्सर उन लोगों द्वारा प्राप्त होती है जो नहीं जानते की विफलता अपरिहार्य है।\nथोड़ी सी हंसी थोड़ी सी सफलता है।\nजीवन आपके विचारों से तेज बदल रहा है।\nसपनों के बिना जीवन अधुरा है।\nनेक इंसान बनने के लिए वैसे ही कोशिश करो जैसे खुबसूरत बन्ने के लिए करते हैं।\nपरिवर्तन और विकास जब होता है जब कोई व्यक्ति खुद को खतरे में डालता है और निकलने के प्रयास करता है।\nअनुशासन के माध्यम से आजादी मिलती है।\nसितारों तक पहुंचने की इच्छा महत्त्वाकांक्षी है और दिल तक पहुंचने की इच्छा बुद्धिमान है।\nदुःख भी भूलभुलैया से बाहर निकलने का एकमात्र तरीका माफ करना है।\nआपके मन की भावना शरीर की प्रतिक्रिया है।\nलोगों को समझें की वे क्या है और वे क्या करने में सक्षम है।\nप्रेरणा ईंधन है जो मानव इंजन चलाने के लिए आवश्यक है।\nएक सफल जीवन का रहस्य यह जानना है की किसी की नियति क्या है।\nहमें अपने लक्ष्य की दिशा में सिर्फ एक तरफ चलना चाहिए, इस तरह अंधेरे में भी सफलता नजर आ जाएगी।\nकाम आदमी की सजा नहीं है यह उसका इनाम, ताकत और उसकी खुशी है।\nइच्छा के बिना कुछ भी नहीं है।\nअपनी महत्त्वाकांक्षा को करने की कोशिश करने वाले लोगों से दूर रहें।\nयदि आप तैयार नहीं है तो आप विफल होने के लिए तैयार है।\nलगातार प्रयास ताकत या बुद्धि नहीं है हमारी क्षमता का ताला खोलने की कुंजी है।\nजो दूसरों पर काबू पाता है वह बल है जो खुद को जीतता है वो मजबूत है।\nआप विफलता की पौशाक में, सफलता की सीढ़ी पर नहीं चढ़ सकते।\nजीवन कठिन है लेकिन अगर आप बेवकूफ है तो ये मुश्किल है।\nप्यार हवा की तरह है, आप इसे देख नहीं सकते लेकिन महसूस कर सकते है।\nजीवन खुद को खोजने के बारे में नहीं है, जीवन खुद को बनाने के बारे में है।\nयदि कोई किताब बार बार पसंद नहीं करता तो उसे पढ़ने में कोई फायदा नहीं है।\nमैं परेशान नहीं हूं की आपने मुझसे झूठ बोला, मैं परेशान हूं की अब से मैं तुम्हारा विश्वास नहीं करूँगा।\nप्यार वह स्तिथि है जिसमे दुसरें की खुशी आपके लिए जरुरी है।\nकिसी से प्यार करने से आपको ताकत मिलती है, जबकि किसी को प्यार करने से आपको साहस मिलता है।\nएक नई आशा के साथ हर रोज शुरू करो, पीछे की बुरी यादें छोड़ें और एक बेहतर कल के लिए विश्वास करें।\nहर दिन जीवित रहें जैसे की आपका जीवन अभी शुरू हुआ है।\nआपको दुनिया में सुधार करने से पहले एक पल इंतजार करने की आवश्यकता नहीं है।\nअगर आप जीवन को प्यार करेंगे तो जीवन आपको प्यार करेगा।\nआनंद केवल धन के कब्जे में नहीं है, रचनात्मक प्रयास के रोमांच में, यह उपलब्धि की खुशी में निहित है।\nइस जीवन में एक व्यक्ति की खुशी अनुपस्तिथि में शामिल नहीं है, बल्कि उसकी भावनाओं के स्वामित्व में है।\nजब खुशी का एक दरवाजा बंद हो जाता है तो दूसरा खुल जाता है लेकिन अक्सर हम बंद दरवाजे पर इतने लंबे समय तक देखते है की हमें हमारे लिए जो दूसरा दरवाजा खोला गया था वह नहीं दीखता है।\nकारवाई हमेशा खुशी नहीं ला सकती है लेकिन कारवाई के बिना कोई खुशी नहीं है।\nयदि आपके पास आसान आत्म संतुष्टि है तो आपके पास खुशी का बहुत सस्ता स्रोत हो सकता है।\nफूलों की खुशबू सिर्फ हवा की दिशा में फैलती है लेकिन एक इंसान की अच्छाई और सकारात्मकता हर दिशा में फैलती है। दुनिया की सबसे बड़ी ताकत जवानी में है हमें अतीत के बारे में पछतावा नहीं करना चाहिए और न ही भविष्य के बारे में परेशान होना चाहिए।\nज़माने में बस ये दो हादसे नही होते, हम तुमसे जुदा, तुम हमारे नही होते!!\nखोजती है निग़ाहें उस चेहरे को, याद में जिसकी सुबह हो जाती है!!\nउसकी आंखे इतनी गहरी थी की, तैरना तो आता था मगर डूब जाना अच्छा लगा!!\nये सर्द शामें भी किस कदर ज़ालिम है, बहुत सर्द होती है, मगर इनमें दिल सुलगता है!!\nकाश में इस समय को पीछे मोड़ सकता, और तुम्हे जिंदगी में जल्दी मिल सकता ताकि और ज्यादा तुमसे प्यार कर सकता!!\nजबसे में तुमसे मिला हूँ और किसी के बारे में सोचना ही छोड़ दिया है!!\nना बुरा सोचा करो, ना बुरा कहा करो, ये ईश्वर की बसाया हुआ प्यार का जगत है इसमें मोहब्बत से रहा करो।\nएक पेन गलती कर सकता है लेकिन एक पेंसिल कभी गलती नहीं कर सकती, क्योंकि उसके साथ एक दोस्त है “\nजीवन जीने के लायक नहीं है जब तक आपके पास कुछ करने के लायक नहीं है।\nउन लोगों पर विश्वास ना करें जो खुद से प्यार नहीं करते और आपको बताते है की मैं आपसे प्यार करता हूं।\nभविष्य उन लोगों के लिए है जो अपने सपने की खूबसूरती में विश्वास रखते है।\nहमेशा ऐसा करें जिसे करने से आप डरते है।\nजीवन वास्तव में सरल है लेकिन हम इसे जटिल बनाने में लगे है।\nहर समय हर किसी को खुश करने का प्रयास करें।\nजो भी आप चाहते है वो भी आपकी तलाश कर रहा है।\nक्या बताऊँ तुम्हे ऐ सनम की तुम्हारी बातें कितनी मीठी हैं, सामने बैठ के फीकी चाय पीते रहते हैं!!\nआपको पहली बार मुस्कुराते हुए देखा ऐसा लगा जैसे पूरी दुनिया हसीन और नयी सी हो गयी है!!\nकोई फ़ूल आप जितना सूंदर नहीं है, जहां भर के सितारे आप जितना चमकदार नहीं है, और मेरी ये जिंदगी आपके बिना कुछ भी नहीं है!!\nजिन्दगी में हर साँसे मीठी लगने लगती है, जब कोई कहता है, की वो मेरे दिल में रहती है!!\nआप जानते हैं कि आप प्यार में हैं तब आप सो नहीं सकते क्योंकि वास्तविकता आपके सपने से ज्यादा हसीन है!!\nआखिर लग ही गयी न तुम्हें मोहब्बत की ठण्ड, कितना समझाया था कि ओढ़ लो तमन्ना मेरी!!\nतुम्हारे साथ गुज़ारे सारे लम्हे मेरे लिए एक बेहतरीन नग्मे की तरह है, जिसे में कहीं भी गुनगुना सकता हूँ!!\nतुम्हारी मुस्कुराहट मुझे जिन्दा रखती है!!\nमाँ से बढ़कर कोई नाम क्या होगा, इस नाम का हम से एहतराम क्या होगा, जिसके पैरों के नीचे जन्नत है उसके सर का मकाम क्या होगा।\nजो आपसे जलते है उनसे घृणा कभी न करें क्योंकि यही तो वह लोग है जो यह समझते है की आप उनसे बेहतर हैं।\nकोई हमारी गलतियाँ निकाल रहा है तो हमें खुश होना चाहिए क्योंकि कोई तो है जो हमें पूर्ण दोष रहित बनाने के लिए अपना दिमाग और समय दे रहा हैं।\nमजबूत होने में मजा तब है जब सारी दुनिया कमजोर कर देने पर तुली हो।\nप्रत्येक दुःख के दस्तावेज पर अपने खुद के हस्ताक्षर होते हैं।\nहर चीज की कदर करना सीख लो क्योंकि न जिंदगी वापस आती है और न जिंदगी में आये हुए लोग।\nसारी उम्र बस एक ही “सबक” याद रखना दोस्ती और दुआ में बस\nकिसी के जाने और आने से जिंदगी रूकती नहीं है बस जीने का तरीका बदल जाता हैं।\nतलाश में बीत गई सारी जिंदगानी ए दिल अब समझा की खुद से बड़ा कोई हमसफर नहीं होता।\nकामयाबी का अर्थ यह नहीं है की आप शिखर पर पहुंच गए, बल्कि कामयाबी का अर्थ यह है की आप शिखर पर बने रहे।\nमैं सब जानता हूं बस यही वो सोच है जो इंसान को कुएं का मेंढक बना देती हैं।\nखुद पर भरोसा रखो क्योंकि जब मुश्किल मकाम आएगा तो ना गैर तवज्जो देंगे और ना अपना कोई काम आएगा।\nदुनिया का सबसे अच्छा उपहार\nगुना बड़ जाती है खूबसूरती, जरा सा मुस्कराने से, फिर भी बाज नहीं आते लोग बुरा सा मुंह बनाने से।\nबातें हर कोई बड़ी-बड़ी कर सकता है पूरी दुनिया को जीतना चाहते हो तो सिर्फ आपका दिल बड़ा होना चाहिए।\nखुशियाँ हमेशा चंदन की तरह होती है दूसरों के माथे पर लगाओगे तब आपकी उँगलियाँ महक जाएंगी।\nदुसरे से जो अपने को तौलेगा सदा अशांत ही रहेगा।\nझूठी शान के परिदें ही ज्यादा फड़फड़ाते है खानदानी बाजों की उड़ान में कभी आवाज नहीं होती।\nझुकने का मतलब ये नहीं है की आपने सम्मान खो दिया, हर किमती चीज को उठाने के लिए झुकना पड़ता है ईश्वर और बुजुर्गों का आशीर्वाद इनमें से एक हैं।\nगुरुर में इंसान को कभी इंसान नहीं दिखता जैसे छत पर चढ़ जाओ तो अपना ही मकान नहीं दिखता।\nअगर आपको गंदे और मैले कपड़ों में शर्म आती है तो आपको गंदे और मैले विचारों में शर्म आनी चाहिए।\nअपनी प्रतिष्ठा का अच्छा ख्याल रखें क्योंकि यही है जिसकी उम्र आप से ज्यादा हैं।\nगलती पर साथ छोड़ने वाले तो बहुत मिलते है पर गलती समझा कर साथ निभाने वाले बहुत कम मिलते हैं।\nजिंदगी तो उसकी है जिसकी मौत पर दुनिया अफसोस करें वरना जन्म तो सभी मरने के लिए लेते हैं।\nमाँ से ऊँचा कद किसी का नहीं हो सकता, क्योंकि ईश्वर जिसे आदमी बनाता है माँ उसे इंसान बनाती हैं।\nजितने से पहले जीत और हारने से पहले हार कभी नहीं माननी चाहिए।\nचाहे फेरे ले लो या कहो कबूल हैं, अगर दिल में प्यार नहीं है तो सब फिजूल हैं।\nजिंदगी में गलत लोगों से मिलने में संकोच मत करना क्योंकि अगर गलत लोगों से मुलाकात नहीं होती तो सही लोगों की कभी पहचान नहीं होती।\nअच्छाई और सच्चाई की तलाश में चाहे पूरी दुनिया में घूम लो, कही नहीं मिलेगी अगर आपके अंदर नहीं हैं तो।\nआर्थिक स्तिथि कितनी भी अच्छी क्यों ना हो, जीवन का आनंद लेने के लिए मानसिक स्तिथि का अच्छा होना जरुरी हैं।\nअच्छे कपड़े पहनने से सिर्फ लोगों को अच्छा लगा सकते हो अच्छे कर्म करो ताकि ईश्वर को अच्छा लगो।\nसफल आदमी वही है जो टूट को जोड़ना और रूठे को मनाना आता हैं।\nगुणों के सहारे आदमी सफल होता है मगर विनय और विवेक साथ हो तो शिखर छु जाता है।\nजब से तुम मेरे जीवन में आए थे, तब से मुझे पता है कि आप वास्तव में अंत तक प्यार करेंगे!!\nनहीं मालूम हसरत है या तू मेरी मोहब्बत है, बस इतना जानती हूं कि मुझको तेरी जरूरत है!!\nआपके बिना एक जीवन की कल्पना करना असंभव है, आप मुझे पूरा कर देते हैं और मैं चाहती हूं कि आप जान लें कि आप मेरे लिए सब कुछ मतलब हैं!!\nआपसे जो इश्क़ है वो बेहद है क्यूँकि, हद और सरहद ज़मीं की होती है दिल की नहीं!!\nअब से मेरा ये विश्वास है कि किसी के भी सपने सच हो सकते हैं, क्योंकि मेरा सपना सच हुआ जब मैं तुमसे मिली और प्यार हो गया। मै तुम्हे हमेशा प्यार करती रहूंगी!!\nनींद सोती रहती है हमारे बिस्तर पर, और हम टहलते रहते हैं आपकी यादों में!!\nआप मेरी खुशी का जरिया हैं, मेरी दुनिया का केंद्र और मेरा पूरा दिल है!!\nमुझे आपकी जरुरत है जैसे दिल को धड़कन की!!\nएक भीगे हुए कागज की तरह कर दिया तूने जिंदगी को, न लिखने के काबिल छोड़ा न और जलने के!!\nजिसका ये ऐलान है कि वो मज़े में है, या तो वो फ़कीर है या फिर नशे में है!!\nकोई मजबूरी होगी जो वो याद नहीं करते, सम्भल जा ऐ दिल तुझे तो रोने का बहाना चाहिए!!\nमुझे भी पता है कि तुम मेरी नहीं हो, इस बात का बार बार एहसास मत दिलाया करों!!\nजब तक आप अपनी समस्याओं और कठिनाईयों की वजह दूसरों को मानते हैं, तब तक आप अपनी समस्याओं और कठिनाईयों को मिटा नहीं सकते।\nभीड़ हमेशा उस रस्ते पर चलती है जो रास्ता आसन लगता है, लेकिन इसका मतलब यह नहीं की भीड़ हमेशा सही रस्ते पर चलती है। अपने रास्ते खुद चुनिए क्योंकि आपको आपसे बेहतर और कोई नहीं जानता।\nइस दुनिया में असंभव कुछ भी नहीं। हम वो सब कर सकते हैं, जो हम सोच सकते हैं और हम वो सब सोच सकते हैं, जो आज तक हमने नहीं सोचा।\nबीच रास्ते से लौटने के कोई फायदा मनहिं क्योंकि लौटने पर आपको उतनी ही दुरी तय करनी पड़ेगी जितनी दुरी तय करने पर आप लक्ष्य तक पहुंच सकते हैं।\nसफलता हमारा परिचय दुनिया को करवाती है और असफलता हमें दुनिया का परिचय करवाती है।\nअगर किसी चीज को दिल से चाहो तो पूरी कायनात उसे तुमसे मिलाने में लग जाएगी।\nमहानता कभी गिरने में नहीं बल्कि हर बार गिरकर उठ जाने में है।\nअगर आप समय पर अपनी गलतियों को स्वीकार नहीं करते हैं तो आप एक और गलती कर बैठते हैं। आप अपनी गलतियों से तभी सीख सकते हैं जब आप अपनी गलतियों को स्वीकार करते हैं।\nअगर आप उन बातों और परिस्थितियों की वजह से चिंतित हो जाते हैं, जो आपके नियंत्रण में नहीं तो इसका परिणाम समय की बर्बादी और भविष्य पछतावा है।\nब्रह्माण्ड की सारी शक्तियाँ पहले से हमारी हैं। वो हम ही हैं जो अपनी आँखों पर हाथ रख लेते हैं और फिर रोते हैं कि कितना अंधकार है।\nहम चाहे तो अपने आत्मविश्वास और मेहनत के बल पर अपना भाग्य खुद लिख सकते हैं और अगर हमको अपना भाग्य लिखना नहीं आता तो परिस्थितियाँ हमारा भाग्य लिख देंगी।\nसपने वो नहीं जो हम नींद में देखते हैं, सपने वो हैं जो हमको नींद नहीं आने देते।\nआप यह नहीं कह सकते कि आपके पास समय नहीं है क्योंकि आपको भी उतना ही समय मिलता है जितना समय महान और सफल लोगों को मिलता है।\nमुसीबतों से भागना, नई मुसीबतों को निमंत्रण देने के समान है। जीवन में समय-समय पर चुनौतियों और मुसीबतों का सामना करना पड़ता है और यही जीवन का सत्य है। एक शांत समुन्द्र में नाविक कभी भी कुशल नहीं बन पाता।\nविश्वास में वो शक्ति है जिससे उजड़ी हुई दुनिया में प्रकाश लाया जा सकता है। विश्वास पत्थर को भगवान बना सकता है और अविश्वास भगवान के बनाए इंसान को पत्थरदिल बना सकता है।\nजीवन में कठिनाईयां हमें बर्बाद करने नहीं आती है, बल्कि यह हमारे छुपे हुए सामर्थ्य और शक्तियों को बाहर निकालने में हमारी मदद करती हैं। कठिनाईयों को यह जान लेने दो की आप उससे भी ज्यादा कठिन हो।\nकिसी डिग्री का न होना दरअसल फायदेमंद है, अगर आप इंजिनियर या डॉक्टर हैं तब आप एक ही काम कर सकते हैं पर अगर आपके पास कोई डिग्री नहीं है तो आप कुछ भी कर सकते हैं।\nअपने सपनों को जिंदा रखिए। अगर आपके सपनों की चिंगारी बुझ गई है तो इसका मतलब यह है की आपने जीते जी आत्महत्या कर ली है।\nबारिश के दौरान सारे पक्षी आश्रय की तलाश करते हैं लेकिन बाज बादलों के ऊपर उड़कर बारिश को ही नजरअंदाज कर देते हैं। समस्याएं कॉमन हैं लेकिन आपका नजरिया इनमे डिफरेंस पैदा करता है।\nमेहनत वो सुनहरी चाबी है जो बंद भविष्य के दरवाजे भी खोल देती है।\nजीवन में दो ही लोग असफल होते हैं, एक वो जो सोचते हैं लेकिन करते नहीं और दूसरे वो जो करते हैं पर सोचते नहीं।\nनादान इंसान ही जिंदगी का आनंद लेता है ज्यादा होशियार तो हमेशा उलझा ही रहता है।\nचिंता इतनी करो कि काम हो जाए, इतनी नहीं कि जिंदगी तमाम हो जाए।\nतेरे गिरने से तेरी हार नहीं, तू इंसान है, अवतार नहीं, गिर उठ, चल, दौड़ फिर भाग क्योंकि जीवन संक्षिप्त है, इसका कोई सार नहीं।\nदूसरों द्वारा की गई गलतियों से सीखो, अपने ऊपर प्रयोग करके सीखने में तुम्हारी आयु कम पड़ जाएगी।\nमैं सब जानता हूँ यही सोच इंसान को कुएं का मेंढक बना देती है।\nइंसान अगर ठान ले तो असंभव कुछ भी नहीं, असंभव शब्द का इस्तेमाल कायर करते हैं।\nगरजने वाले बादल बरसा नहीं करते, इसलिए कहिए मत बल्कि करके दिखाईये।\nइंसान को कठिनाईयों की आवश्यकता होती है, क्योंकि सफलता का आनंद उठाने के लिए यह जरुरी है।\nअगर जीवन में कुछ पाना है, तो अपने तरीके बदलों इरादे नहीं।\nजो चाहा वो मिल जाना सफलता है, जो मिला है उसको चाहना प्रसन्नता है।\nयूँ ही नहीं मिलती राही को मंजिल, एक जूनून सा दिल में जगाना होता है, पूंछा चिड़िया से कैसे बनाया आशियाना, बोली-भरनी पड़ती है उड़ान बार-बार, तिनका-तिनका उठाना होता है।\nगलती करना बुरा नहीं है, गलती से सीख न लेना बुरा है।\nमहान चरित्र का निर्माण महान और उज्जवल विचारों से होता है।\nघनघोर अँधेरा एक तरफ, छोटे से दीपक की रौशनी एक तरफ, मुश्किलें कितनी भी हों, दीपक की तरह डटे रहो, सफलता तुम्हारे कदम चूमेगी।\nअगर इंसान में कुछ करने की इच्छा हो तो दुनिया में कुछ असंभव नहीं है।\nमुश्किलों से भाग जाना आसान होता है, हर पहलु जिंदगी का इम्तिहान होता है, डरने वाले को मिलता नहीं कुछ जिंदगी में, लड़ने वालों के कदमों में जहान होता है।\nहर चुनौती में एक बड़ा अवसर छिपा होता है।\nहम सभी के पास समान प्रतिभा नहीं है, लेकिन हमारे पास समान अवसर हैं, अपनी प्रतिभा को विकसित करने के लिए।\nआप जो करने से डरते हैं उसे करिए और करते रहिये अपने डर पर विजय पाने का यही सबसे आसन तरीका है।\nसफल लोग कोई अलग काम नहीं करते, वो बस अलग तरीके से काम करते हैं।\nजीवन में ज्यादा रिश्ते होना जरुरी नहीं है, पर जो रिश्ते हैं उनमें जीवन होना जरुरी है।\nकेवल एक विचार को अपना लक्ष्य बनाओ और सभी कुविचार छोड़कर केवल उसी के बारे में सोचो, सफलता तुम्हारे कदम जरुर चूमेगी।\nहम हमेशा इस बारे में सोचते हैं कि हमारे पास क्या नहीं है, हम इस बारे में कभी नहीं सोचते कि हमारे पास कितना है।\nहर दिन मेरा सर्वश्रेष्ठ दिन है, यह मेरी जिंदगी है मेरे पास यह क्षण दुबारा नहीं होगा।\nजो लोग कहते हैं कि वो व्यस्त हैं, वास्तव में वो अस्त व्यस्त हैं।\nआप जिस नजर से इस दुनिया को देखेंगे, आपको दुनिया वैसी ही दिखाई देगी।\nशेर आगे छलांग मारने के लिए एक कदम पीछे हटाता है, इसलिए जब जिंदगी आपको पीछे धकेलती है, तो घबराएँ नहीं, जिंदगी आपको ऊँची छलांग देने के लिए तैयार है।\nजिस व्यक्ति ने कभी गलती नहीं की, उसने कभी कुछ नया सीखने की कोशिश नहीं की।\nजो व्यक्ति अपनी सच नहीं बदल सकता, वो कुछ नहीं बदल सकता।\nमहान कार्य ताकत से नहीं लगातार लगे रहने से होता है।\nअगर तुम अपनी जिंदगी अपने तरीके से नहीं जीओगे तो लोग अपने तरीके तुम पर लाद देंगे।\nतुम कभी नहीं जीत सकते जब तक तुम शुरू नहीं करते।\nअगर तुमने सपना देखा है तो तुम इसे कर सकते हो।\nदर्द दर्द है पर डर सबसे बड़ी बीमारी है ये आदमी के व्हीलचेयर पर होने से ज्यादा खतरनाक है।\nअगर आप वही करते हैं जो आप हमेशा से करते हैं, तो आपको उतना ही मिलेगा जो हमेशा से मिलता आया है।\nसिर्फ वही यात्रा असंभव है जो अभी तक आपने शुरू नहीं की।\nन भूत की सोचो, न भविष्य की चिंता करो, अपने दिमाग को वर्तमान में लगाओ।\nरास्ते बदलो मत, रास्ते बनाओ।\nअगर जिंदगी मे कुछ पाना हो तो तरीके बदलो इरादे नहीं।\nअगर नियत अच्छी हो तो, नसीब कभी बुरा नहीं होता।\nसंघर्ष इंसान को मजबूत बनाता है, फिर चाहे वो कितना भी कमजोर क्यों न हो।\nडर मुझे भी लगा फांसला देखकर, पर मैं बढ़ता गया रास्ता देखकर, खुद-बी-खुद मेरे नजदीक आ गई मेरी मंजिल मेरा हौंसला देखकर।\nजमाने की नजर में थोडा सा कद उठा कर चलना सीख ले ए दोस्त, मोम जैसा दिल लेकर फिरोगे तो लोग जलाते ही रहेंगे।\nवजह से तो डूबता है हर कोई, बेवजह डूबो तो कुछ बात बने।\nजो नहीं है हमारे पास वो ख्वाब है, पर जो हैं हमारे पास वो लाजवाब हैं।\nसही दिशा में कदम बढ़ते चलो इससे फर्क नहीं पड़ता की तुम्हारे कदम कितने छोटे हैं पर अपने गोल की तरफ बढ़ते चलो।\nकभी न खत्म होने वाली ख़ुशी को पाने का कोई भी शोर्टकट नहीं है।\nअगर तुमने चमत्कार नहीं देखे तो खुद एक चमत्कार बन जाओ।\nजिंदगी में तुम्हारे पास मौका होता है या तो कड़वे बन जाओ या अच्छे। कडवे बनने से अच्छा है अच्छे बन जाओ।\nतुम अभी सही रास्ता नहीं देख पा रहे हो इसका मतलब यह नहीं है कि सही रास्ता है ही नहीं।\nजिंदगी बिना अंग के? या जिंदगी बिना लिमिट के?\nमेरे पास अवसर था कि मैं भगवान को दोष दूँ, उसके लिए जो मेरे पास नहीं है या धन्यवाद दूँ उसके लिए जो मेरे पास है।\nलगातार असफलता मिलने पर भी अपने उत्साह को न खोना सफलता है।\nजो खेले वो खिले अगर आप खेलते तो आपके व्यक्तित्व का विकास होगा।\nइस बात को व्यक्त मत होने दीजिये कि आपने क्या करने के लिए सोचा है, बुद्धिमानी से इसे रहस्य बनाए रखिए और इस काम को करने के लिए दृढ रहिए।\nखुश रहो लेकिन कभी संतुष्ट मत रहो।\nजल्दी गुस्सा करना आपको जल्द ही मुर्ख साबित कर देगा।\nजैसा आप सोचते हैं, वैसा आप बन जाएंगे।\nजितना एक मुर्ख व्यक्ति किसी बुद्धिमानी भरे उत्तर से नहीं सीख सकता उससे अधिक एक बुद्धिमान एक मूर्खतापूर्ण प्रश्न से सीख सकता है।\nगलतियाँ हमेशा क्षमा की जा सकती हैं, यदि आपके पास उन्हें स्वीकारने का साहस हो।\nमैं फुट के अवरोध को पार करने की नहीं सोचता, मैं एक फुट का अवरोध ढूंढता हूँ जिसे मैं पार कर सकूं।\nएक शब्द में, यह आदर्श है कि तुम परमात्मा हो।\nएक शब्द में, यह आदर्श है कि तुम परमात्मा हो।\nअगर धन दूसरों की भलाई करने में मदद करे, तो इसका कुछ मूल्य है, अन्यथा ये सिर्फ बुराई का एक ढेर है और इससे जितना जल्दी छुटकारा मिल जाए उतना बेहतर है।\nकभी मत सोचिए कि आत्मा के लिए कुछ भी असंभव नहीं, ऐसा सोचना सबसे बड़ा विधर्म है, अगर कोई पाप है तो वो यही है ये कहना कि तुम निर्बल हो या अन्य निर्बल हैं।\nसाख बनाने में बीस साल लगते हैं और उसे गंवाने में बस मिनट अगर आप इस बारे में सोचेंगे तो आप चीजें अलग तरह से करेंगे।\nकभी अपनी सफलता के लिए दूसरों पर निर्भर मत हो। अपने रास्ते खुद बनाओ।\nमहान कार्य तभी हो सकता है जब आप अपने काम को प्यार करो।\nमैं झूठ बोल सकता हूँ कि मेरी बीवी मेरे लिए खाना बनाती है लेकिन ऐसा नहीं है। मेरी बीवी ने कभी खाना बनाना नहीं सीखा लेकिन उसके पास घर पर बहुत अच्छे कुक्स हैं।\nमैं वास्तव में यकीन करता हूँ कि मेरा काम ये सुनिश्चित करना है कि लोग हंसे।\nमैं अपने बच्चों को नहीं सिखाता कि हिन्दू क्या है मुस्लिम क्या है।\nकामयाबी और नाकामयाबी दोनों ही जिंदगी के हिस्से हैं दोनों ही स्थायी नहीं हैं।\nयदि आप दूसरों की मदद कर सकते हैं तो अवश्य करें, यदि नहीं तो कम-से-कम उन्हें नुकसन नहीं पहुंचाएं।\nप्रसन्नता पहले से निर्मित कोई चीज नहीं है। ये आप ही के कर्मों से आती है।\nहास्य टॉनिक है, राहत है, दर्द रोकने वाला है।\nजिंदगी करीब से देखने में एक त्रासदी है लेकिन दूर से देखने पर एक कॉमेडी।\nकिसी आदमी का असली चरित्र तब सामने आता है जब वो नशे में होता है।\nसफलता की खुशी मनाना अच्छा है पर उससे जरुरी है अपनी सफलता से सीख लेना।\nआपके असंतुष्ट कस्टमर आपके सीखने का सबसे बड़ा स्त्रोत हैं।\nमनुष्य नश्वर है उसी तरह विचार भी नश्वर हैं। एक विचार को प्रचार-प्रसार की जरुरत होती है जैसे कि एक पौधे को पानी की। नहीं तो दोनों मुरझा कर मर जाते हैं।\nजीवन लंबा होने की बजाए महान होना चाहिए।\nमैं ऐसे धर्म को नहीं मानता हूँ जो स्वतंत्रता, समानता और भाईचारा सिखाए।\nएक महान आदमी एक प्रतिष्ठित आदमी से इस तरह से अलग होता है कि वह समाज का नौकर बनने को तैयार रहता है।\nयह एक रणक्षेत्र है, मेरा शरीर, जिसने बहुत कुछ सहा है।\nप्रिय टीवी मिडिया और मेरे घर के बाहर खड़ी फैन्स, कृपया इतना तनाव मत लीजिए और इतनी कड़ी मेहनत मत कीजिए।\nसच कहूँ तो मैं कभी आइकॉन, सुपरस्टार विश्लेषणों के चक्कर में नहीं पड़ा। मैं हमेशा खुद को एक अभिनेता के रूप में देखता हूँ जो अपनी काबिलियत के अनुसार जितना अच्छा कर सकता है कर रहा है।\nइंसान को यह देखना चाहिए की क्या है। यह नहीं देखना चाहिए कि उसके अनुसार क्या होना चाहिए।\nएक मेज, एक कुर्सी, एक कटोरा फल और एल वायलन, भला खुश रहने के लिए और क्या चाहिए?\nसभी प्रचार लोकप्रिय होने चाहिएं और इन्हें जिन तक पहुंचाना है उनमे से सबसे कम बुद्धिमान व्यक्ति के भी समझ में आने चाहिए।\nसभी महान आन्दोलन लोकप्रिय आन्दोलन होते हैं। वे मानवीय जूनून और भावनाओं का विस्फोट होते हैं जो कि विनाश की देवी या लोगों के बीच बोले गए शब्दों की मशाल के द्वारा क्रियान्वित किए जाते हैं।\nशत्रुओं को मित्र बनाकर क्या मैं उन्हें नष्ट नहीं कर रहा?\nहमेशा ध्यान रखिए कि आपका सफल होने का संकल्प किसी भी और संकल्प से महत्वपूर्ण है।\nमैं जो भी हूँ या होने की आशा करता हूँ, उसका श्रेय मेरी माँ को जाता है।\nसंस्कृति मन और आत्मा का विस्तार है।\nसंकट के समय हर छोटी चीज मायने रखती है।\nअसफलता तभी आती है जब हम अपने आदर्श, उद्देश्य और सिद्धांत भूल जाते हैं।\nअज्ञानता बदलाव से हमेशा डरती है।\nमैं तुम्हें एक नया आदेश देता हूँ: एक दूसरे से प्रेम करो। जैसे मैंने तुमसे प्रेम किया है, तुम एक-दूसरे से प्रेम करो और यह समझो कि मैं हमेशा तुम्हारे साथ हूँ, हाँ काल के अंत तक।\nमेरे लिए दरवाजे खोलो, जैसे मैंने खुद को तुम्हारे लिए खोला है।\nआजादी की रक्षा केवल सैनिकों का काम नहीं है। पूरे देश को मजबूत होना होगा।\nहमारी ताकत और स्थिरता के लिए हमारे सामने को जरुरी काम है उनमें लोगों में एकता और एकजुटता स्थापित करने के बढ़ कर कोई काम नहीं है।\nएक जग बूंद-बूंद करके भरता।\nअतीत पे ध्यान मत दो, भविष्य के बारे में मत सोचो, अपने मन को वर्तमान क्षण पर केंद्रित करो।\nस्वास्थ्य सबसे बड़ा उपहार है, संतोष सबसे बड़ा धन है, वफादारी सबसे बड़ा संबंध है।\nतीन चीजें ज्यादा देर तक नहीं छुप सकती, सूरज, चंद्रमा और सच।\nमिट्टी का मटका और परिवार की कीमत, सिर्फ बनाने वाले को ही पता होती है, तोड़ने वाले को नहीं।\nबादशाह तो वक्त होता है, इंसान तो यु ही गुरुर करता है।\nजो मंजिलों को पाने की चाहत रखते हैं, वो समंदरों पर भी पत्थरों के पुल बना देते हैं।\nस्वार्थी मित्रों से बड़ा कोई और शत्रु नहीं होता।\nसबर कर बंदे मुसीबत के दिन भी गुजर जाएंगे, हसी उड़ाने वालों के भी चेहरे उतर जाएंगे।\nघृणा घृणा से नहीं प्रेम से खत्म होती है, यह शाश्वत सत्य है।\nकिसी आत्मा की सबसे बड़ी गलती अपने असल रूप को न पहचानना है, और यह केवल आत्मा ज्ञान प्राप्त करके ठीक की जा सकती है।\n", "it.txt": "Sull’amore (in sanscrito “a-more”, ciò che non muore) sono stati scritti libri, trattati, enciclopedie. Ma a volte i pensieri si possono esprimere in una pagina, in una frase, in una parola.\nSono molti i libri di aforismi sull’amore, mentre cercando su google la parola “frasi e aforismi sull’amore” si trovano migliaia e migliaia di pagine di aforismi di ogni tempo sull’amore.

In attesa di qualche volenteroso, ho raccolto in questo articolo (quasi un ebook, frutto di un lavoro di mesi e mesi) 300 tweet scritti da 300 autori di Twitter.

У нас никогда не будет друзей. Мы никогда не займемся никаким бизнесом, потому что решим: \"Ничего не получится\" Или: \"Она причинит мне боль\". Или: \"Я пару раз уже влюблялся неудачно, а потому...\". Всё это чепуха! Вы не должны упускать жизнь. Каждый раз прыгайте с утеса и, пока летите вниз, отращивайте крылья.\nЯ не обижаюсь на людей, я просто меняю о них мнение. Можно вытащить человека из грязи, но нельзя вытащить грязь из человека.\nВаш мозг может все. Абсолютно все. Главное, убедить себя в этом.

Если они ненавидят Вас, то Вы — лучший.\nРасставание для любви — то же, что и ветер для костра: маленькую любовь оно потушит, а большую воспламенит еще сильнее\nХорош не тот, кто ищет в людях слабость.\nЯ никогда не хотел революции, в которой льется человеческая кровь. Я никогда не призывал к резне, в которой свинец размазывает мозги по стенам! Революция может быть только одна — революция сознания. И только. Все остальное — лишь бессмысленная мясорубка, превращающая плоть в бабло.\nСказать то, что думаешь, порою величайшая глупость, а порой — величайшее искусство.\nВсе дело в мгновении. Оно определяет жизнь.\nКогда государство начинает бороться с подростковой преступностью и наркоманией, оно забывает самое главное: бороться с этим невозможно, но можно сделать футбольные школы и высшее образование доступнее, чем крэк и уличные банды.\nЯ не знаю иных признаков превосходства, кроме доброты.\nСчастье не зависит от того, кто вы есть или что у вас есть. Оно зависит исключительно от того, что вы думаете.\nВ этом мире нет гарантий, есть только возможности.\nЕсли вы хотите сделать что-то великое в один прекрасный день, помните: один прекрасный день — это сегодня.\n", "tr.txt": "Bazen en iyi seçim vazgeçmektir.\nAklı yarda olanın gözü yerde olur.\nİşimiz Allah’a kalmışsa olmuş bil.\nBir kere güldün konu nerelere geldi.\nÖzlemin azı çoğu olmaz ağırdır işte!\nOnlar sevmeyi yan yana olmak sanıyor.\nİyi bir ağaca sarılan gölgesiz kalmaz.\nEn güçlü iki savaşçı sabır ve zamandır.\nSen çok sev de bırak giden yar utansın.\nİnsanı en çok yıpratan şey iyi niyetlidir.\nVefa çok ağır yüktür.
